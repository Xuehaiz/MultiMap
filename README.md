# Multi-object counting in real-time videos

An online multi-object counting method based on [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) and tracking-by-detection (i.e., [StrongSORT](https://github.com/dyhBUPT/StrongSORT) and [ByteTrack](https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack)). The tracking implementation is based on [yolo_tracking](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/yolo_tracking/releases/tag/v8.0).
